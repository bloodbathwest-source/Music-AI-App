# PR #22 Finalization Instructions

## Problem Identified
PR #22 (https://github.com/bloodbathwest-source/Music-AI-App/pull/22) is currently failing CI tests due to a dependency conflict:
- The workflow `.github/workflows/tests.yml` specifies `pydantic==2.5.0`
- However, it also specifies `pydantic-settings==2.11.0`
- `pydantic-settings 2.11.0` requires `pydantic>=2.7.0`
- This creates an unresolvable dependency conflict

## Fix Applied
The fix has been applied to THIS branch (`copilot/finalize-music-generation-service`) in commit `c162b55`:
- Updated `.github/workflows/tests.yml`
- Changed `pydantic==2.5.0` to `pydantic==2.7.4`
- This satisfies the pydantic-settings dependency requirement
