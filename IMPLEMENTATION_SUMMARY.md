- Shuffle and repeat modes
- Lyrics display

#### Library (`components/library.py`)
- Grid and list view modes
- Song sorting (Recent, Title, Genre)
- Playlist management
- Delete functionality
- Play buttons for each song

#### Search (`components/search.py`)
- Search by title, artist, genre
- Genre and key filters
- Multiple sort options
- Real-time results

#### AI Creator (`components/ai_creator.py`)
- Three creation modes: Full Song, Music Only, Lyrics Only
- Parameter controls (genre, key, mode, tempo, emotion)
- Advanced options expandable section
- Live preview of generated content
- Download buttons
- Auto-save to library

#### Visualizations (`components/visualizations.py`)
